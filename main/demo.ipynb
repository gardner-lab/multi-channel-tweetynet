    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebooks illustrates usage of the Tweetynet convolutional neural network for birdsong syllable classification and supporting software. The network processes magnitude spectral windows of raw audio recordings by extracting visual features, downsampling the input via 2D convolution and pooling operations, and finally providing downsampled activation maps as input to an LSTM, which feeds a linear readout unit that classifies discrete time steps as belonging either one of the pre-specified syllable types or a period of non-singing. In this notebook, we illustrate how to generate magnitude spectrograms for a variety of parameterizations, generate labelvectors from song annotation files, create datasets for training and evalution, and build + train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This software's unique contribution is in its support of \"wideband\" spectral input to the Tweetynet neural network. More concretely, our implementation of Tweetynet can process a 3-dimensional input spectrogram window where depth is created by stacking copies of the same window that are computed with distinct FFT sizes (and resulting aspect ratios). Tweetynet applies a separate layer 1 convolution and pooling operation to each channel to appropriately featurize and downsample input to matching dimensions prior to the second convolutional layer. In addition, provided tooling for spectrogram and labelvector generation are easily parameterized with wideband input in mind. "

    "## Write Spectrograms\n",
    "For each provided audio file we compute and save to disk a full duration spectrogram as well as consecutive overlapping windows. Short windows are useful for training. Full duration spectrograms can be used for reference and/or model evalution on song-by-song basis. As discussed, this version of Tweetynet supports processing multiple input spectrograms as \"channels\". Accordingly, with a single audio file it is easy to generate multiple spectrograms using different parameterizations to render different output dimensions. Our spectrogram generation procedure includes small quirks to produce output images with an identical number of pixels for different FFT setups. For example, with spectrogram A, B, and C, produced with FFT sizes 256, 512, and 1024, the height (frequency dimension) of C will be twice that of B and four times that of A. An identical relationship holds for the time dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In addition to actual spectrograms and spectrogram windows this method writes other metadata to disk with each record. Details follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This should take a bit of time depending on the dataset size, number of N_FFTs, and extraction sliding window overlap. With default parameters on a stock Macbook Pro each minute of audio requires 1-1.5 minutes for spectrogram generation.\n"

    "To create label vectors from audio file anntations we need to know the network's output sizes for predetermined input sizes. Instiate the network with these parameters and save the labelvec length to be used later. NOTE: intuitively, we would expect the length of the labelvector to equal the length of the input spectrogram in the horizontal (time) dimension; however, as discussed, this software supports processing multiple spectrogram \"channels\" of different aspect ratios (time-frequency resolutions). Typically, we would not downsample in the time dimension, but in some cases we might want to hit specific dimensions across all input channels. Being sensitive to these cases we run a run a test input through the network on instantiation and confirm labelvector size."
